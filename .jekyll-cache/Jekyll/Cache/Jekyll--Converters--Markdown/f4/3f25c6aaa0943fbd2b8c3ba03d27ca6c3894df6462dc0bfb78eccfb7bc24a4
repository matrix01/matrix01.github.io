I"ü	<p>For my last two project I had the opportunity to setup the base architecture for iOS project. Since most of my projects were in MVC until now it was hard to choose a Base Architecture. I learned two most popular architecture, MVVM with clean architecture and Viper. I will discuss more about choosing a architecture on later posts. While implemeting source code for projects I faced difficulty of creating many files that needs to be created at same format with some specific files. It was frustrating. So I started to look for a solution and the solution was right in front of me and it was creating module with those specific files. Vola!!! Problem solved.</p>
