Notes are about daily things and ideas written down as an aid to memory. I am starting this note to understand better about organizing thoughts or actions of regular life. I would like to share my thoughts about tech and travelling to places. I am from Bangladesh and currently living in Japan. I am working in the tech companies since 2015 and I aquired lots of knowledge from my home country and current work place. And learning is a continuos process which I want to keep going in a organized way. Let's see how far it goes!!!

My main track is iOS development. And recently I got many different kind of interest in different fields. Travelling and photography are became most important part of life.


I am using the friday theme from [GitHub](https://github.com/sfreytag/friday-theme) developed by Simon Freytag. Thanks for this simple beautiful theme.
